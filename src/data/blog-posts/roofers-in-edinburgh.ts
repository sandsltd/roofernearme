        <div class="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">How often should I have my roof inspected in Edinburgh?</h4>
            <p>We recommend annual inspections, typically in autumn before winter weather sets in. Properties in exposed areas or with traditional slate roofs may benefit from bi-annual checks.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">Do you work with World Heritage Site properties?</h4>
            <p>Yes, our network includes specialists in Georgian and Victorian properties who understand the traditional techniques and materials required for authentic restoration and repair within the World Heritage Site.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">What permissions do I need for roof work in Edinburgh?</h4>
            <p>While many repairs don't require permission, work on listed buildings or in conservation areas needs approval from Edinburgh City Council and potentially Historic Environment Scotland. Our roofers can guide you through the process.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">What warranties do Edinburgh roofers offer?</h4>
            <p>Most quality roofers provide 10-20 year warranties on new roofs and 5-10 years on major repairs, all backed by comprehensive insurance and manufacturer guarantees.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">How do tenement roof repairs work?</h4>
            <p>Tenement roof repairs typically require agreement between all owners and may involve shared costs. Our roofers can help coordinate with other owners and manage the process efficiently.</p>
