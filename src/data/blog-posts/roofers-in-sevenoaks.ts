          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">How often should I have my roof inspected?</h4>
            <p>We recommend annual inspections for most Sevenoaks properties, particularly before autumn when leaf fall can affect drainage. Properties with mature oak trees nearby (common in Sevenoaks) may benefit from additional checks after stormy weather.</p>

          </div>
          <div>
