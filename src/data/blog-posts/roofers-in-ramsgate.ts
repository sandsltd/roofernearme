          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">How often should I have my roof inspected in Ramsgate?</h4>
            <p>We recommend annual inspections for most Ramsgate properties, but seafront and clifftop homes should consider bi-annual checks in spring and autumn due to increased exposure to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">What materials are best for Ramsgate's coastal properties?</h4>
            <p>Marine-grade materials with enhanced corrosion resistance are ideal for seafront properties. Traditional slate and clay tiles work well for period properties set back from the sea, while modern synthetic slates with salt-resistant fixings offer a good compromise.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">Do you provide emergency repairs for storm damage?</h4>
            <p>Yes, our network includes emergency roofers who can respond quickly to storm damage, which is particularly important in Ramsgate's exposed coastal areas. Most can arrive within 1-4 hours for assessment and temporary repairs.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">What special considerations apply to conservation area properties?</h4>
            <p>Ramsgate Conservation Area properties often require like-for-like materials and traditional techniques. Our specialist roofers understand the planning requirements and can handle all necessary permissions and heritage-sensitive repairs.</p>
