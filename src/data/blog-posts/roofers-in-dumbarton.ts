        <div class="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">How often should I have my roof inspected?</h4>
            <p>We recommend bi-annual inspections for most Dumbarton properties, typically in spring and autumn. Properties exposed to estuary winds or surrounded by trees may benefit from quarterly checks to prevent weather damage.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">What materials are best for Dumbarton properties?</h4>
            <p>Traditional Scottish slate is ideal for period properties, while high-grade synthetic materials with superior wind and rain resistance work well for modern homes. Our local roofers can advise on the most appropriate materials for your specific property.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">What warranties do Dumbarton roofers offer?</h4>
            <p>Most quality roofers provide 10-20 year warranties on new roofs and 5-10 years on major repairs, all backed by comprehensive insurance and manufacturer guarantees tailored to Scottish weather conditions.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">How do you handle emergency repairs?</h4>
            <p>Our network includes emergency roofers who understand the urgency of roof issues in the Scottish climate, typically arriving within 2-4 hours for assessment and temporary weather-proofing if needed.</p>
